Future ideas for vEdit:

- [ ] REFACTOR "View" to "Panel" in every use throughout the codebase
  - [ ] Rename "Search[View]" to "SearchPanel"
  
- [ ] Remove the storage of the current session state in localStorage
      to simplify the implementation of the SessionManager.
  
- [ ] Add project setting to control the 
  - [ ] visiblity of hidden characters
  - [ ] the default space size

- [ ] Add ability to drag the panels by pressing the CMD key

- [ ] Add panel-control div on the top-right
  - [ ] Add way to set word-wrap per editor panel
  - [ ] Add way to change the z-index of editor panel

  - [ ] Add way to toggle line-numbers of editor panel
  - [ ] Add way to minimise/maximise a panel
  - [ ] Add way to fold a panel into an icon and unfold it again
  
- [ ] Add a "panel" container on the top, which can to take up
      icons, that the user doesn't want to have in the work space
      at the current moment
   - this is a sort of "keep the panel remindet"
   
- [ ] Add way to open up editor panels by dropping a patch file on
      the work space
  - the editor views are opened based on the chunks in the patch file

- [ ] Add a way (from the heads up display) to control the currently
      displayed panels on the workspace and rearrange them
      
- [ ] Add a way to render a minimap of the source code in an editor view
      and allow to navigate to this point
      
- [ ] Add way to fold away a block of lines in the editor panel
  
- [ ] Add way to search for files given a file name
  - do this by extending the search panel
  - add a new dblclick and content-render handler, that handles
    the output from the unix `find` command
